This repository contains hyperparameter optimization of a DNN by performing grid search on model training parameters consisting of: 
Activation functions, batch size, learning rate, number of neurons per layer, number of layers, optimizer choice. All denoted by hp_xxxx

main.py is the main script used for training the model
naca4_clcd_turb_st_3para.pkl is the pickle file containing data on airfoils used for model training/testing

final.pdf is the report analyzing DNN performance in predicting wing performance once model hyperparameters are optimized
